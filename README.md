# Project Name

**Author**: Your Name Goes Here
**Version**: 1.6.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This assignment will provide users access to books within google's vast library. Thanks to some cool forms a user will be able to search for the title of books and possibly even search for authors as the page is developed. 

## Getting Started
The key to getting started is the proof of life for the application. If I can get the basic server to listen all I need to proceed with is the proof of life for the actual page itself and ensure those chunks perform as anticipated. 

## Architecture
HTML, EJS, JavaScript, CSS, .Env, JSON packages, GitIgnores 

## Change Log
03-01-2021 3:05 pm created the basic strucuture for the page
03-01-2021 3:25 pm Added in the readme information to describe the application


01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
