## Overview
This assignment will provide users access to books within google's vast library. Thanks to some cool forms a user will be able to search for the title of books and possibly even search for authors as the page is developed. 

## Getting Started
The key to getting started is the proof of life for the application. If I can get the basic server to listen all I need to proceed with is the proof of life for the actual page itself and ensure those chunks perform as anticipated. 

## Architecture
HTML, EJS, JavaScript, CSS, .Env, JSON packages, GitIgnores
